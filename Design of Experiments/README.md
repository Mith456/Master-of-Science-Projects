# INTRODUCTION 
The focus of this experiment is to design and perform an experiment adhering to the fundamentals of Experimental Designs. The experiment titled Optimization of Wireless Internet Experience is designed to obtain best internet experience from the possible conditions. The experiment is scrutinized with the statistical approach and computing tools like JMP and Design Expert. The statistical analysis provides strong conclusions with reference to the best Signal Strength experienced from a router when subjected to varying operation conditions.

## Aim of the Experiment
The experiment Optimization of Wireless Internet Experience is aimed to determine the best Internet experience for the users. During the experiment, we intend to check how the different factors affect the Signal strength. 

## Factors and Response Variable
Factors of interest includes the following:
1) Distance:Signal stregth varies with the distance between router and device. This factor was tested at two levels.
2) Physical Obstruction: The more obstructions you have between the transmitter and receiver, the more chance there is that the signal strength will be affected.This factor was tested at two levels
3)Channel: Co-Channel interference is a major problem as there are too many Wi-Fi devices on the same channel. This factor was tested at 2 levels.

Response Variable was Signal Strength measured in decibel- milliwatts (dBm). 

## Factorial Design
A 2^k factorial design with three replicated trials were designed and experimented. The experiment was optimized through the application of Regression analysis to identify the best combination of factors levels which yield strong signal strength.
