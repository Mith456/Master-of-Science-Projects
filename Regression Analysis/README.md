# Regression-Analysis
Regression Analysis of High-Performance Concrete data

## Purpose of the Project
High-Performance Concrete contains several ingredients into account that is used in concrete construction industry. Concrete compressive strenght is a hot topic in concrete construction. The aim of the project is to perform Regression Analysis to identify significant variables that influence the response variable.

## Data Integration
The dataset was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The size of the dataset observed is 1031 samples, 8 regressors and a response variable "Concrete Compressive Strength".

## Stages of Project
Model 1:Fit original model with all predictors
Model 2:Multicollinearity and Data Transformation
Diagnosis of Leverage and Influential points
Model 3: Variable selection and Model building
Model Validation

## Softwares
R programming
Minitab
